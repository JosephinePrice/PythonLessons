America knows it\\'s poison , which is why they spread it , massive hypocrites! Long live the Islamic Emirate! Glad Qatar is helping out mashallah .  Honestly countries in the middle East with state approved military bases usually tend to be worse than when the British made some places protectorates . Not only does the US pretty much dictate their foreign policy, but they also try hard to influence their internal affairs and liberalise them .

Talibanistan is looking great so far Based Taliban Will they end up in a gaint hole? A month ago I would have been hating on the taliban because all you hear in the news in America is \"taliban bad\" but after looking into it myself they look alright. I\\'m not a Muslim so I obviously don\\'t agree with everything but I am a Christian so alot of values are the same. They are alot more conservative than most American conservatives which is great. As long as America and Afghanistan leaves each other alone and just worries about their own stuff, I\\'ll be hoping this new Afghanistan succeeds because it don\\'t look to bad. Allahu Akbar Poojeets are seething To discredit Taliban bravery, panjshiri, seculars and Hindus say that Pakistan  bombed Panjshir yesterday by f-16.😳 Alhamdulillah. Indians must be crying now. As per their propaganda,taliban were defeated by Amrullah Saleh 😜 💙 Whats he saying Make Afghanistan Great Again!!

This is awesome! Did the Taliban already capture Panjshir or only parts of it? \"Afghanistan is bad. talibana are evil doers and treat everyone bad\"\\n\\nmeanwhile, taliban looking ajd feeding their captured prisoners and taking care of them If they swore an Oath by Allah to be loyal to the new government would they honor it?   Perhaps men who are willing to die for what they believe shouldn\\'t be wasted?   Maybe they can be shown the vision of The Emirate of Afghanistan?   🤔   Idk, may God guide your decisions. now that afghanistan is one and together hopefully everything improves for the people of afghanistan assalamu alaikum malang, i wonder what emirate policy is for sports like football or cricket in the country Those aren’t terrorists, they’re fighting for their freedom. I hope these terrorists will abandon their ill-will against the Afghan government and will work for the good of the country. Nice Well done for giving them mercy Im glad that you give them a mercy 👍 How are they terrorists for not wanting your rule? Lel. You don\\'t even know the meaning of the word.

This is better than any other cause my taxes are going for except for the interstate highways which they spend more than the total original cost to construct each year on “maintenance” and are still full of potholes. Although I\\'m not the biggest fan of the Taliban the soldiers marching in white clothing was hella cool Nice vid Masha Allah! <3 It\\'s amazing that they gave you hundreds of billions in military equipment.\\n\\nGood Bless with building the Emirate of Afghanistan.

Neet 4s0u6_x000D_\\nvur.fyi Taliban should start small and try to manufacture handguns and AKs within the country and move on to other weaponry later as well.

Maybe those dogs would be a fine meal for your Chinese friends New Talibani dogs Let\\'s be real here, if they kill the dogs, they\\'ll be no better than Australia at this point. Thank you.. for this report,  all we have been hearing is that the Teliban will torture them, cut off their noses.. that they hate animals Please don\\'t kill them.. The dogs helps you aginst IS That\\'s a great pitch for a Disney movie It would have been more humane to have shot the dogs than to leave them in cages abandoned.\\nThe fact that someone may have opened the cages and they are running free does not improve their ability to survive. The fact the Taliban hasn\\'t sentenced them to death means less than nothing. These Monsters are capable of Evil beyond words. Hi Malang, I hope you guys will withdraw kosovo(American puppet state) recognition. You have full support from people of Serbia. wa’l-salaam. Could you get footage of the dogs? They are Talibani dogs now.

Plz lemme have one malang. My dad worked his as off & paid the taxes for these toys🙍🏻\\u200d♂️ Malang pls make a discord server Can yall end the semiconductor shortage around the world so Afghanistan can be prosperous again??? Malang, would you say that the sign is a subtle joke. The shop is called \"Sneed\\'s Feed & Seed\", where \"feed\" and \"seed\" both end in the sound \"-eed\", thus rhyming with the name of the owner, Sneed. The sign says that the shop was \"Formerly Chuck\\'s\", implying that the two words beginning with \"F\" and \"S\" would have ended with \"-uck\", rhyming with \"Chuck\". So, when Chuck owned the shop, it would have been called \"Chuck\\'s Feeduck and Seeduck\". Death to america or no? Please don\\'t hurt the service dogs Can I have one lol zogbots screeching Okay let\\'s be honest, do you even know how to fly that thing? Hey you coming on instagram? I work 9-5 and pay taxes so elites can give free helicopters 🚁 around the world. Take good care of it malang Based now i really want to take control of a middle eastern country, get the usa to invade and stay 20 years, make them leave, and retake control with some of their stuff! Based. The Taliban beat the usa without advanced technology like this.  Imagine what they can do WITH this sort of thing.. lookin good They’re holding hands, that’s adorable. You’re welcome to my tax money evidently. Lol full masti The Taliban need to post this on Ifixit and protest on right to repair. That\\'s American for \"suck a dick, we\\'re out\" It was probably expected that they\\'d do that.\\n\\nThe good news is the US, EU, and China have maintenance schools that are freely open to anyone with the $ to pay for them.\\n\\nOnce you get your rare earth mines setup you should be able to find intelligent, hardworking men to send to maintenance school.\\n\\nYou could them sign 10-20 year contracts and you even set it up as a binding part of the contract with the school, that they move back to Afghanistan and fix your stuff.\\n\\nThe bad news is you\\'ll also need CNC machines shops, engineers, it\\'ll be entire industry.  The good news is building all of that will help build Afghanistan.\\n\\nYou\\'re sitting on literally gold and rare earth.  Maybe keep on eye on corruption tho.  The resource trap is real.  Might want to think about making corruption a capital offense right from the start.\\n\\nIdk, hopefully you\\'ll can get stuff going.  👍🏻 The pentagon did say that about 150 aircraft and vehicles in kabul were disabled beyond \"unrepairable\" before leaving Kabul so it probably won\\'t be much use to them. That’s extremely petty they did that bcoz their invincibility just got shattered by the Taliban that\\'s why they are doing this cowardice acts but this is exactly what they are they are good at destroying everything loool they left with their tail between their legs, it\\'s their way of coping with their loss All this while the world suffers a semiconductor shortage Ali  Mustafa best TRT reporter. They did that so the Taliban can’t use it plain and simple It\\'s to make them unusable obviously and you don\\'t have the technology to fix them unless you get help from China/Russia/Pakistan or such Ofcourse you know why they did it, out of Spite to leave Defeated. so wasteful its SOP to disable stuff you cant take with you, chances are they wont be fixable and you dont have spare parts I dont know much about helicopters are those fixable? USA enough equipment enough for an entire army there All your helicopter are belong to us Isn’t that guy from the LA news? Вояки хреновы.

Pretty epic. Not for america though lmao. Biden is a clown. this is awesome lol. Justice and peace for the Afghan people, May Allah bless us all _Yo , Mohammed!

In under a day, we already have over 50 members! I can\\'t wait to meet you Malang. Boring. Show some people getting blown up. They picked her up over a wall because she claimed over it. DISCORD SERVER WHEN? Despicable 🤢🤢🤮🤮 \"Women rights\" But reddit and twitter users say the taliban are the bad ones :( Big deal. They tell her to go over and she refuses.. so they have to lift her up. Lol. What about it... you spread as much lies about USA as they do about you guys. Would be better if you could work together to dispell ISIS and then respect eachothers lands instead. You guys have definitely earned your bragging rights. Congratulations! With any hope the fallout from this will make people in my shitbag country come to their senses and never elect liberals again. hope you\\'re safe homie. ISIS (likely hired by US contractors or CIA) have been starting trouble God bless you from Scotland mashallah https://discord.gg/pSadnB8jMd https://discord.gg/SX7Pr746 malang discord server Due to popular demand I have created the Malang Khosty fan server, come join\\n\\nhttps://discord.gg/ahMMe9z7\\n\\nboost the server for cool roles, and when Malang joins he will become an admin Keep it up!

Awww grandpa 🥺 first Woah it\\'s like clash of clans in real life i just want to buy some of the night vision the US left behind.. Can’t wait until the IEA starts using jets to bomb rebels in panjshir Unironically looks cleaner than the rancid streets of California, the Taliban will make Afghanistan a very great country I\\'m sure may god save you from bullets blessed brother May the son of Shir-e-Panjshir never surrender! https://discord.gg/SX7Pr746 Malang discord server You guys find any higher definition cameras over there? hopefully we can look forward to some quality content The side that believes allah shall prevail Stay strong brother but why can’t you bomb them with your jets helicopters and drones?

MAZAY KAWO MAZAY MASHA\\'ALLAH Hello Malang What do you think is the best gta? Im big fan of yours from europe and would like to know your answer. Hello Malang god\\'s love have you played GTA San Andreas or V or both? smh, the ANA didn\\'t even take out the key when they surrendered. Yall should make a twitch streaming about using dem murican armament Allha akbar Based based we live in a period where the taliban fighters are making youtube videos about whats happening in afghanistan and memeing on twitter Least based Taliban so uh, they go UP, not sure if you knew about that.\\n\\nmaybe try yanking the thingy stick a little harder? HERE FROM PRICKPOSTING NICE HELICOPTER A matter of time before they learn how to manufacture these stolen helos I cant believe this timeline lol LOL. You are like cavemen compared to us.  But maybe some deserter can teach you. Great May Allah bless Taliban it is so amazing after how much worse the timeline has been getting year after year that it would be the actual Taliban to turn things around 🤣👌🏻💕 you have to practise flying in digital combat simulator I wish I was there on that black hawk You guys should make a discord server Fly high my brothers 🙏 If you find this video, and know about the whole taliban meme, know that you mastered the interned memes Lmao this is great live stream when To provide greater understanding to young people in the world on the true purpose of the Taliban, my advice would be that the Taliban should create an official discord server Lmao... read the description 😂 We need a discord server Lmao you guys are vibing. Gotta love Taliban Wait this isn\\'t GTA 6 best video so far LMAO can i use an oppressor mk2 irl now Hello Malang is it true that you guys are killing Turkic people in Afghanistan? Multiple news channels in Turkey says taliban is killing Turks there. Nice video malang, I can’t wait to meet you in the taliban discord server. Allah hu Akbar Fuckin based and redpilled! Keep it up Malang! malang make a discord server I agree with BigA\\'s idea of a discord server, we can potentially have a taliban official League of Legends Esports team by the end of the month Good. Love from Bangladesh Hey malang, I finally want to travel to Afghanistan but I have to renew my passport and other documents\\nhope to see your country and people soon! Why is she wearing the hijab wrong . Showing her hair smh Discord Sever? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19TVX5tB3GE Taliban should get on Gab, it’s a website where you can speak without getting banned Allah ekber Brother please add english subtitles Hey Malang, have you created the official Taliban Discord server yet? I can\\'t wait to have a place to communicate with my fellow Muslims. Allah hu Akbar! white nationalists have more respect for the Taliban than they do the US government. did u force her to say this? Very good Is there any way an American tourist can pay a large pecuniary amount of money for a visa by February 2022 to go to Afghanistan? Could you provide your videos with translation for us ignorant westerners? I am interested what Taliban is going to do now that the world powers have to deal with you guys and I don\\'t trust media. Thanks for posting this! Means much. Don’t put music in your videos omg banger sound track yall gonna execute them? Inshallah Based allah akbar Bismillah they listened to Allah to not kill their Muslim brothers and they didn’t listen to cia (shaytan) Will you be tea bagging them Malang? 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏✌ Basedban Talibs are based. may Allah bless you and make you a thorn in hypocrites\\' throats. Maybe China can help build highway and stuff.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t sign a debt agreement with them tho.\\n\\nJust as easy to promise you\\'ll sign an agreeable rare earth mineral contract with them and get them to do work now, and then negotiate a lot later when you\\'re in a position of power and they\\'ve already built the infrastructure.  😂🤭\\n\\nI would consider adding a long term warranty clause to anything they build tho, like 30-50 years, bc lets face it, sometimes their quality is not great. Hey Malang, I think that once the country\\'s occupationist forces (US) leave, maybe the emirate government could work a deal with China to build a high speed railway through the emirate? It would probably boost the economy a lot to have high speed railways, the highway is looking beautiful by the way!\\n\\nImagine a railway that goes from the border of Afghanistan all the way to China, it would generate so much money as well, since you would reduce shipping travel by a lot all the way from the gulf to mainland China, and avoid Indian water so it\\'s being lined with dirt? that won\\'t last Based Dear Malang,\\nI think that the Taliban should start its own official Discord Server. Discord is an international, internet messaging app where you can create unique chatrooms for communities. I think the Taliban would really benefit from making a discord server as you can inform people who misunderstand the Taliban, as well as allow Taliban supporters such as myself to communicate and discuss from all across the world. Sending lots of support for your cause, Alex. Good luck with your channel i wish you best! I am your 600th Subscriber. im addicted to your content akhi Taliban make highway? Salam Alaykum, I am Syrian and I wanted to know what do you think about the situation in my country and what do you think of Bashar al Assad and the rebels? Do you want me to invite you to a archive discord server of Jihadi videos? Videos from every group please discord sever Great video Malang, as always! Nice Finally time to start fixing instead of destroying We did it reddit 💪💪Hell yeah Go ahead brozzer Was this project began by the Emirate?  Or have they taken over for former Occupation Regime workers?  Either way, it looks rather modern, and more advanced than many of Afghanistans dirt roads. He\\'s a great hero of the yehudiyan. BHL always talks about what a great hero Massoud was and how France must do everything to help his son. Who is this Ahmad? Who\\'s Ahmad Shah? Lol Based Fakers make speeches about reform, heroes make actions 💪💪 \\nGreat job🙏 Lel. Mad because some guy didn\\'t want the rule of Taliban. Cry more. Malang let\\'s play pubg mobile Malang, let\\'s play Call of Duty Warzone, you got a PlayStation? By the way, what about his picture at the Kabul Airport? You guys keeping it or not? I remember seeing that large picture of his and thinking \"what an evil looking guy.\" That guy has a scary looking face. Make a discord server Make a discord server You should make a discord server so that it\\'s easier for us to ask questions etc. Can you post a verification video? So we know this account is not fake. Hello do you want to play pubg, I got you an account you can use since your old one is banned. We can talk using discord. Very nice video 👍. Do you use the messaging app discord? Why taunt a dead man Malang? I might not have agreed with him but he was honourable and he wanted the best for his country, you should respect and not insult the dead. Who is he? Can I buy them Much rather you than Israel 🤷\\u200d♂️ Allah gift Hey, i recognise that one! The one on the top left was paid for by my taxmoney. Mashallah. My boys hit up loot lake Please create a discord server. I bet you still prefer your trusty AK though They should give Malang all those guns and build a giant multi-rifle wielding mech for him. Inshallah Talibans love the white man\\'s gear. I understand though, you cannot even make cars lol :P just like the joggers. Malang what is the taliban doing about the imagine dragons????? united states is dumb Are these Afghans or Suncondese? Based! Good job Malang! You must be compensating for something how do i donate Fantastic to show what\\'s really out there Hey, do you use the messaging app discord? Why would someone dislike this video? Very generous donation Hey malang what is your opinion on the redditors trying to hex Taliban? You should thank the us-taxpayer for it. Also why did they just left all of these weapons ? Do they hate money? Well, that\\'s where those taxes went. Enjoy! Make a discord server in case you get banned Mashallah Alhamdulillah Around the world, we all just want to have a normal life without being exploited by colonialism and neoliberalism. I want to come to Kabul, I want to escape the degenerate west Malang what are the taliban doing about the imagine dragons?????? Salam Alaykum, I am Syrian and I wanted to know what do you think about the situation in my country and what do you think of Bashar al Assad and rebels? Will there be the option of booking an all-inclusive holiday to Afghanistan soon? I am particularly fond of continental breakfasts, so it would be excellent if you could instruct your resorts to provide this meal. Germany/Sweden in the future Gotta say great job over there Mr Khosty I am white nationalist and Christian from Europe, would it be safe for me to travel to Kabul now without being kidnapped or killed maşallah brother Nice arg bruh really cool 👍 Alright, my nigga, Malang? You\\'re a huge inspiration to us cave dwellers. We rely on God and the 🌞 for company. But seeing this is really nice to see. I have a poster of you on my wall :) +rep :steamhappy: She sounds terrified When will Afghanistan be open for tourist in the USA? Nicer than San Francisco. Who\\'s the person talking? Aye yo Malang hook me up on twitter, wanna do some pubg mobile duos together? In Afghanistan do you guys have Soma, it is yummy dish all across the world, I hope you can try King Salam alilakum brother what do you think about the Islamic emirates of Afghanistan\\'s relationship to al qeada?

Brother you must not say the things that the zionists that control the internet will ban you for, moderate your words so your message may continue inshallah 🙏 Can someone translate?
